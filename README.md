# GMU CS325 Introduction to Game Design
## Purpose of repository
This repository was forked by Mustafa Fitrat, a 2018-2021 student in George Mason University for CS 325. This is an archived repository as this course has been completed. It remains public in case the professor of the course uses it as an examples, and for assisting students in understanding how to use Phaser.
## Basic information on repository
This repository contains all of your games as well as a few simple "hello, world!" templates for a game made with Phaser. This repository should be marked as GitHub Pages. This lets you run your games directly from github! Check it out: [http://gmu-cs325.github.io/cs325-game-prototypes/](http://gmu-cs325.github.io/cs325-game-prototypes/) Fork this repository and start making your own games!
You can't run the `index.html` for a Phaser game directly from your local machine without a local webserver. If you try, the images won't load (your browser will prevent it, thinking it is malicious). To get around this, if you have Python, simply enter the directory and type `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` (Python 2.x) or `python -m http.server` (Python 3.x). If you have [`node.js`](http://nodejs.org/), you can easily install (`npm install http-server -g`); then enter the directory and run a local HTTP server (`http-server`). Once you have your local server running, browse to it using Chrome: most likely [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) or [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).
## List of games programmed
1. Assignment 2: Attempted to produce a rhythm game similar to *Drum Hero*. However, due to limited time I only produced a working drum that plays sound.
2. Assignments 4-7: Attempted to produce a drag racing game based off of Need for Speed's race mode of the same name.
