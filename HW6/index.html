<h2>Drag Racing</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The game takes a classic arcade gamemode from the Need for Speed franchise and focuses to make the gameplay quick and simple.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The use of arcade physics and having the camera follow the player's vehicle through the map.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
That Phaser CE examples are a great place to get help and find out solutions to problems. The easiest part was finding assets and making the game look cool, the hard part was figuring out camera movement.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Majority of my assets were taken from the internet and either had my touch sprinkled onto it, or just blended together.

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The game got help from a phaser CE examples, but the gameplay is closest to the Need for Speed Franchise's Drag Racing gamemode, which primarily was in Need for Speed Underground til Need for Speed Most Wanted 2005.
<ul>
<li>Camera Movements example <a href="https://www.phaser.io/examples/v2/camera/basic-follow"></a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A fast, timed racing game where you and your friend speed down the roadway, 1st place is the only goal.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Chickens because they're everywhere in the desert.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
I used keyboard input, used the racing game genre. There is no randomness, only skills.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The main game mechanic I wanted to test was "The Hot Potato" as I wanted the game to force players to not just continuously hold the accelerate button. But that was not implemented yet.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
A fast, fun experience.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can drive the car forward by pressing W or the Up Arrow Key. I wanted to have a speedometer that showed whether the car was going to overheat when the player held their acceleration key for too long. I also wanted a minimap to show the distance and have the maps much longer.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Timing and reflexes as the first player to accelerate first wins.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Chickens enjoy watching drag racing, so you and your friends race to entertain them in order to save the world.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
To all the racers out there that just want to go fast.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Less than a minute.
</li>
