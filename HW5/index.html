<h2>32-Bit Wheel Turner</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The game takes a classic arcade gamemode from the Need for Speed franchise and focuses to make the gameplay quick and simple.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
How timers are used to display a symbol on the screen and users can interact in order to increase their car's speed.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
That Phaser CE examples are a great place to get help and find out solutions to problems. The easiest part was finding assets and making the game look cool, the hard part was figuring out how to temporary display the symbols and getting input to work. Also, a bug occured where the map would disappear if I increased the height.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Majority of my assets were taken from the internet and either had my touch sprinkled onto it, or just blended together.
<ul>
<li>Button: Custom Made</li>
<li>Cars image: <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/aeJ59">Car Images</a></li>
<li>Road Image: <a href="https://www.pinterest.de/pin/413627547018117282/">Road Image</a></li>
<li>Game Music: Orgy - Blue Monday (Downloaded from Youtube)</li>
<li>Game Symbols: Based off Need for Speed Most Wanted, yet custom made</li>
<li>Title Screen background <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/6910307/Pixel-Desert">Picture Link</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The game got help from a phaser CE examples, but the gameplay is closest to the Need for Speed Franchise's Drag Racing gamemode, which primarily was in Need for Speed Underground til Need for Speed Most Wanted 2005.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A fast, timed racing game where you and your friend speed down the roadway, 1st place is the only goal.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
None.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
I used keyboard input, used the racing game genre. There is no randomness, only skills.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The main game mechanic I focused on was shifting, where players have to time their shift whenever a symbol arrived. This would result in increasing their max velocity to a certain degree.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
A fast, fun experience.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Player 1 and shift using the Up Arrow Key while player 2 can shift using the W key. Symbols will pop up in which the player can shift and gain a speed boost to go faster than their rivals.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Timing and reflexes as the player who shifts perfectly wins.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The world is finite, with many places for a drag race. Why don't you and your buds take some cars out and go have fun.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
To all the racers out there that just want to go fast.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Less than a minute.
</li>
