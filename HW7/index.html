<h2>Drag Racing</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The game takes a classic arcade gamemode from the Need for Speed franchise and focuses to make the gameplay quick and simple.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The ability for timed input and effects using timers and sprites.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
That Phaser CE examples are a great place to get help and find out solutions to problems. The easiest part was finding assets and making the game look cool, the hard part was figuring out input timing and fixing bugs.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Majority of my assets were taken from the internet and either had my touch sprinkled onto it, or just blended together.
<ul>
<li>Menu music by Kevin Macleod</li>
<li>Button in Menu was custom made</li>
<li>Shift Images were custom made</li>
<li>Car images: <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/aeJ59">Car Images</a></li>
<li>Road Image: <a href="https://www.pinterest.de/pin/413627547018117282/">Road Image</a> and others mashed with Tiled</li>
<li>Game Music: Took random songs from <a href="Whttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6G1JXzujoBrE7MC6mV-pe">Qilliam Maranci on Youtube</a>, go check him out</li>
<li>Title Screen background <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/6910307/Pixel-Desert">Picture Link</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The game got help from a phaser CE examples, but the gameplay is closest to the Need for Speed Franchise's Drag Racing gamemode, which primarily was in Need for Speed Underground til Need for Speed Most Wanted 2005.
<ul>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A fast, timed racing game where you and AI speed down the roadway, 1st place is the only goal.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
I used keyboard input, used the racing game genre. There is a slight randomness because of the timers, but dominantly skills.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game uses timed input which works alright. It could be polished, however it does work fine for the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
A fast, fun experience.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The vehicle speeds up on its own. The player must hit the shift key at the right time for their vehicle to go faster. Hitting shift before anything pops on screen is an early shift, hitting when a blue orb comes is a good shift, hitting when a green orb shows is a perfect shift, and hitting when a red orb shows is a late shift. Aim for perfect and good as they make your vehicle go faster than late and early shifts.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Timing and reflexes as the player must time hitting the shift key to beat the AI.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
An open world, with roads, sports cars, and a group of friends who wanna race. Go for it.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
To all the racers out there that just want to go fast.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Less than a minute.
</li>
